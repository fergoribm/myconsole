  <p>
    <b>My Console</b> is an experimentation looking at a cross-region console, offering fast lookup and navigation of resources across regions, together with resource tagging.
  </p>

  <h4>Start by setting a token</h4>
  <p>
    The token is used to interact with Cloud Foundry APIs. Without a token, you can't retrieve your Cloud Foundry orgs, spaces, apps and services.
    <a routerLink="/settings" preserveQueryParams preserveFragment>Set your token here.</a> Then click <i>Refresh All</i>.
  </p>

  <h4>Pick a visualization</h4>
  <p>
    Use the toolbar on the left to switch between different visualizations of the resources.
  </p>

  <h4>Then search for resources</h4>
  <p>
    Type any text in the Search bar to find resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    The search supports a few keywords. It always performs a full inclusive search, i.e the resource must match all criteria.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>region</b> to focus on resources in a specific region. Possible values are ng, eu-gb, au-syd.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>org</b> to focus on resources in a specific organization
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>space</b> to focus on resources in a specific space
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>service</b> to select service instances of a specific service type
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>tag</b> to select resources with the given tag
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>diego</b> to select apps based on whether they have been deployed on the Diego architecture
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>url</b> to select apps matching a given route
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>status</b> to select apps with a given status
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>updated_at</b> to select resources after a given date, updated_at:2016-12-31
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A few examples of what you can search on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a routerLink="/list" [queryParams]="{q: 'status:down org:John'}"><b>status:down org:John</b></a> to view all apps currently down in the organizations having their name containing <i>John</i> across all regions
    </li>
    <li>
      <a routerLink="/browse" [queryParams]="{q: 'service:cloudant'}"><b>service:cloudant</b></a> to view all Cloudant service instances
    </li>
    <li>
      <a routerLink="/browse" [queryParams]="{q: 'todo'}"><b>todo</b></a> to find all resources having <i>todo</i> in their name
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Behind the scenes</h4>
  <p>
    My Console retrieves all your organizations, spaces, apps and services across regions and stores this information in the local storage of your web browser. Thus the information is not always up-to-date but good enough for a global snapshot of your resources and to navigate the regions, orgs and spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data is stored in a PouchDB, in the browser local storage. Client is built with Angular + Material.
